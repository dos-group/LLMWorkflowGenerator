It is primarily used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, transformers do not process data sequentially, which allows them to handle longer sequences more efficiently.\n\nThe key innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. This mechanism enables the model to capture dependencies between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.\n\nTransformers consist of an encoder and a decoder, both made up of multiple identical layers. Each layer includes a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence, often using the encoder's output as context.\n\nThe transformer architecture has been highly influential in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and has led to the development of many successful models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\nTransformers have also been adapted for other types of data, such as images and graphs, leading to models like Vision Transformers (ViT) and Graph Transformers.
