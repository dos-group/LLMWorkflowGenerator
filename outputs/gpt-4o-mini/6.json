    "output": "To accomplish the task of sending a car title to an insurance company using the provided API, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the car title file.\n2. Find the contact ID for the insurance company.\n3. Retrieve the email address of the insurance company using the contact ID.\n4. Send the email with the car title attached.\n\nHere's the Python 3 function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef send_car_title_to_insurance():\n    # Step 1: Find the car title file\n    car_title_file = find_file(\"car title\")\n    \n    if car_title_file is None:\n        print(\"Car title file not found.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the contact ID for the insurance company\n    insurance_contact_id = find_contact_id(\"insurance company\")\n    \n    if insurance_contact_id is None:\n        print(\"Insurance company contact not found.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Step 3: Retrieve the email address of the insurance company\n    insurance_email = find_contact_email(insurance_contact_id)\n    \n    if insurance_email is None:\n        print(\"Insurance company email not found.\")\n        return\n    \n    # Step 4: Send the email with the car title attached\n    subject = \"Car Title Submission\"\n    text = \"Please find attached my car title.\"\n    attachment_paths = [car_title_file]\n    \n    send_email(insurance_email, subject, text, attachment_paths)\n\n# Execute the function\nsend_car_title_to_insurance()\n```\n\nThis function uses the provided API functions to find the necessary files and contact information, and then sends the email with the car title attached. \n\nNow, I will execute the function `send_car_title_to_insurance()`. However, please note that I cannot actually execute the code in this environment, but you can run it in your own Python environment where the API is available.",
